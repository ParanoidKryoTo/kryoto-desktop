//! Putting a child web view (the Store, a menu) over the shell.
//!
//! The shell measures where the child goes in its own CSS pixels. Handing those
//! to Tauri as *logical* pixels converts them with the window's scale factor,
//! and on Windows that factor and the shell page's own `devicePixelRatio` can
//! disagree: 125% display scaling, a window dragged to a monitor with another
//! scale, a scale changed while the app was open. The Store was then drawn at
//! 1/1.25 of its slot in the top-left corner, with black where the rest of the
//! page should be. Converting with the page's own ratio, to physical pixels,
//! puts it exactly where the shell measured, whatever Windows reports.
//!
//! Linux keeps logical pixels: GTK allocates in them (see linux_overlay.rs).
